hoof is a library to manage hierarchical data with an interface designed for speech
hoof also comes with an example terminal program that has a text interface

primary purpose is to allow someone who is blind to easily create manipulate and navigate hierarchical data
a speech interface limits the need for upper case letters or punctuation or symbols
hoof organizes data as a hierarchy of values
values contain words and each value can have a list of children values

size of the library is less than 20 kilobytes

hoof is a high quality library
compiles without warnings against c 89 c 99 and c 11 standards
checks and handles all error conditions
if malloc fails will not crash or corrupt memory or corrupt state but will safely return an out of memory return code
valgrind reports no memory leaks or errors
test coverage is 100 percent branch coverage
all code is documented
all functions are reentrant
contains no third party code
written entirely by jeremiah

to build just run the script named build
hoof has no dependencies other than standard c libraries
the only standard c functions hoof requres are malloc calloc free strcmp fopen fread fwrite fclose rename and remove
to build manually just compile the c files in the source directory and create a static library
	cd source
	gcc -c *.c
	ar rcs libHoof.a *.o

if you want to change the functions that hoof calls for malloc calloc and free then define HOOF_USE_MEM_HOOKS and provide hoofHookMalloc hoofHookCalloc and hoofHookFree
if you want errors logged then define HOOF_ENABLE_LOGGING and provide hoofHookLog
if you want to modify hoof then define HOOF_BE_PARANOID to turn on extra paranoid checks in the library
