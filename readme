to use hoof you only need to copy the hoof dot c and hoof dot h files into your project
hoof has no dependencies other than standard c libraries
the only standard c functions hoof requres are malloc calloc free strcmp fopen fread fwrite fclose rename and remove

if you want to change the functions that hoof calls for malloc calloc and free then define hoof_use_mem_hooks and provide hoof_hook_malloc hoof_hook_calloc and hoof_hook_free
if you want errors logged then define hoof_enable_logging and provide hoof_hook_log
if you want to modify hoof then define hoof_be_paranoid to turn on extra paranoid checks in the library
