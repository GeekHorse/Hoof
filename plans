make sure all functionality is in hoofCore as single functions and not inline in the state machine

need a tail value at the end of the page that can actually be the current line/value
that way when we delete a line, we always go down, and it's not confusing if we go down, up, or out
possibly also have a head value at the top of the page?

change from ascii to hoof-encoding
0-9 '0' through '9'
10-35 'A' through 'Z'
36 -
37-62 reserved
63 space

words need a type
	text
	number
		with the raw s64 number in the word
	binary

the hoofDo function where we pass in a word, we can also pass in callbacks the 'server' can use to draw or play sounds

change example client to be
	hoof open file
	?

replace
	delete current word, start inserting where old word was

undo, probably just undelete

index and total counts for down, right, and depth
insert number state
add spell word state
fine line that contains X
move most

read page

search

sort
prioritize?

need move most up and move most down commands
in future will need move 3 up or move 8 down 

read...
when you say "stop" it moves the current word to where it was reading?
also implement "stop" in read line?
or have another "keeping moving and reading until i say stop" command?

probably need to add help commands to our states
probably need to add a version state

make a hoof_to_c converter
make a c_to_hoof converter

create file manual

make short versions of commands? and use these in our save file format?
d for down
i for in
l for left
m for most ... or mu md ml mr mi mo ?
n for new ... or nu nd nl nr ni no ?
o for out
r for right
u for up
v for value
w for word
